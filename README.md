# Bug Hunt

Adversarial bug finding skill for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code). Uses 3 isolated AI agents to find and verify real bugs with high fidelity.

## How it works

Inspired by [@systematicls's article](https://x.com/systematicls) on exploiting LLM sycophancy for better code review:

1. **Hunter** - Scans your code and reports every possible bug (biased to over-report)
2. **Skeptic** - Tries to disprove each bug (biased to dismiss false positives)
3. **Referee** - Reads the code independently and makes final verdicts

Each agent runs in a **completely isolated context** — they can't see each other's reasoning, only structured findings. This prevents anchoring bias and produces high-fidelity results.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danpeg/bug-hunt.git ~/.claude/skills/bug-hunt
```

Claude Code auto-discovers skills in `~/.claude/skills/`.

## Usage

```
/bug-hunt              # Scan entire project
/bug-hunt src/         # Scan specific directory
/bug-hunt lib/auth.ts  # Scan specific file
```

## Update

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/bug-hunt && git pull
```

## Uninstall

```bash
rm -rf ~/.claude/skills/bug-hunt
```

## How the scoring works

The scoring incentives are load-bearing — they exploit each agent's desire to maximize its score:

- **Hunter**: +1/+5/+10 for low/medium/critical bugs. Motivates thoroughness.
- **Skeptic**: Earns points for disproving false positives, but pays **2x penalty** for wrongly dismissing real bugs. Creates calibrated caution.
- **Referee**: Symmetric +1/-1 scoring with "ground truth" framing. Makes it precise rather than biased.
